# Let's Build a Simple Database

This is my practice for awesome tutorial [Let's Build a Simple Database](https://github.com/cstack/db_tutorial), but written in Go.

I decided to write this in "C style" as in the tutorial. The main goal was to try low-level operations with data in Golang than to write idiomatic Go code.

The project was abandoned in chapter 10 :)
